If you do not get selected this round of auditions, please keep in touch, as we should have more opportunities available in the future as this new show grows.<br><br>If you have any questions, please feel free to email cocorunseverything@gmail.com or message @comedy_pageant on instagram.</div>	CallToAudition	1	2025-09-06 12:16:00.512348	2025-09-06 14:54:07.876875
8	instruction_text	<div>Big changes on the scheduling front! As we go into 2026, we are no longer doing midnight movies, but 9pm shows on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of each month. Midnight has been fun, but we anticipate it will be much easier to get people out to a 9pm show vs a midnight show, so we're grateful Stars &amp; Garters has given us this slot. As a condition of the time change, we are now only doing movies that are less than 2hrs long (get ready for a lot of kids movies and horror, which seem to be the genres with shortest runtimes). The pay for these shows will continue to be $25 per show or $1 per ticket sold, whichever is greater.<br><br>We have also been invited to do a mini-show of 30 minutes as part of the entertainment at Stars &amp; Garters' <em>NYE Spectacular Spectacular</em>. They have a clip from a Dean Martin Christmas special that we will be laugh-along-live-ing to. There will only be one rehearsal and three comedians for this shorter show. It is still a paid gig (waiting on the exact details of what they're offering for pay, but you can expect similar to what you'd make on a normal show).<br><br>Please let us know as soon as possible which of our upcoming shows (and their associated rehearsals) you are able to do by submitting here. After you have submitted, you can edit your availability here on CocoScout if anything changes.<br><br>We can't guarantee everyone gets on a show this round, but will try our best to get everyone opportunities in the future. We anticipate having two shows a month for the rest of 2026.</div>	Questionnaire	1	2025-11-22 19:25:53.099443	2025-11-25 02:43:22.974675
1	header_text	<div>Please fill out this application before <strong>10pm Tues, Sep 9</strong> to be considered for an audition slot for <em>Comedy Pageant</em>. <br><br>Auditions will be held in 30-minute slots <strong>3pm-5pm Sun, Sep 14</strong> at Stars &amp; Garters, 3914 N Clark (the former Otherworld Theatre location). You will be notified via email by end of day Sep 10 letting you know if/when you have received an audition slot.<br><br><strong>What is </strong><strong><em>Comedy Pageant</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br><br><em>Comedy Pageant</em> is a short-form improv show with a beauty pageant motif. Each <em>Comedy Pageant</em> show features one host and four sash-wearing “contestants” (North Bitch, West Bitch, South Bitch, and East Bitch) who compete in various improv games to win the tiara and sash that tell the world they are the ultimate Pageant Bitch. (We would like to stress that “bitch” is a gender-neutral and polite title in <em>Comedy Pageant</em> World.) The games will be divided into a “talent section”, “personal interview section”, etc., like a beauty pageant, but will be classic games you know like “New Choice”, “Sex With Me”, “Top That”, etc. For shows, the host will be dressed formally, while the contestants are welcome to wear whatever they’re comfortable performing in (plus their sash).<br><br>Starting Oct 3, we will be performing bi-weekly Fridays 7pm at Stars &amp; Garters.<br><strong><br>What should I expect at auditions?</strong><br><br>We are looking to add several improvisers and a couple hosts to the pool of talent that we cast shows from. The audition will simply consist of doing improv games in a group. There is no need to bring/prepare anything other than a good attitude!<br><strong><br>What else should I know?</strong> <br><br><strong>Show days </strong>- Each show lasts 75 min (including a 10 min intermission). Call time for performers will be 6:30pm. Each show will have a different cast, based on availability, but everyone in our pool of talent should anticipate doing multiple shows throughout our run. <br><br><strong>Pay</strong> - We believe in compensating talent. For each show, each performer (contestants and hosts) will receive either $20 or $1 per ticket sold, whichever is greater (hopefully greater). Each week’s winning Pageant Bitch will also receive a $10 scholarship to Burger King (a joke prize, but a legit gift card!).<br><br><strong>Rehearsal</strong> - We will have a rehearsal/kick-off event for all talent at 11am on Sat Sep 27. Attendance will not be required, but this is currently our only rehearsal for the year, so we highly encourage coming so we can discuss show structure, make sure everyone is on the same page with how to play our games, and get to know each other!<br><br>Please feel free to email <strong>cocorunseverything@gmail.com</strong> or message <strong>@comedy_pageant</strong> on instagram if you have any questions/concerns/thoughts. We want to set you up for success!</div>	CallToAudition	1	2025-09-06 05:28:58.541765	2025-09-06 14:54:07.817441

3	header_text	<div><strong>What is </strong><strong><em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S.</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br><br><em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S. </em>(Menaces Assessing Strategic Tactics Evaluation, Rogues Making Intelligent Maneuvers Diabolically, Shhh) is a new character-based presentation-driven semi-scripted comedy show. The premise: villains are in a board meeting together and presenting their evil schemes via slides. Each villain will spend about 10 minutes presenting their master plans. There will be some banter amongst the villains at the conference table, and a portion of each presentation where the audience gets to ask questions.<br><br>We currently have a three-show run the third Friday of every month at Stars &amp; Garters, starting November 21st. If these shows are successful, we anticipate continuing monthly beyond these first three shows.<br><br><em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S.</em> is the creation of Gib Christensen who will be hosting and directing the show. Coco Runs Everything will be producing the show.<br><br> <strong>What type of villains are you looking for?</strong><br><br>The villains may be completely made up characters, or fictional villains from pop culture, or people from real life/history, or the embodiment of a concept...it's completely open to your creativity. All will be in costume as their character and play that character for the entirety of the show.<br><br>The tone is more playful than truly evil (no hate, just hench!). We do not want to see "My plan to kill all [group of people]". We do want to see your villain's plan to rule a breakfast cereal empire or shrink every penis in the world or get revenge for the time the Batmobile parked in their spot. Keep it fun!<br><br>For the December 19th show, we are looking specifically for holiday-related villains/schemes.<br><br><strong>What is expected of me if I am selected for a show?<br><br></strong>You will need to prepare a 10-ish minute slide show presentation on your villainous plan, and come prepared to answer questions about it in character. You are expected to provide and wear a costume for your character.<strong><br><br></strong>We will not be running rehearsals for this show, but will be doing individual video consultations the week of the show to make sure everything is looking good, and provide any support needed to have your character/presentation ready to shine by show day. Call time will be 8:30pm with show at 9pm on show day.<br><br><strong>What is the pay?<br></strong><br>Half of the ticket draw for each show will go into a pool to be split amongst the talent in that show, so we can't guarantee a specific amount, but the more people we can get to the show, the more you'll make. Talent will be compensated via Zelle/Venmo the night of the show.<br><br><strong>Timeline?<br></strong><br>We will be accepting video audition submissions until Oct 29th. You will be notified by Nov 1st if we'd like to see your villain in one of our scheduled shows. We will also potentially hold a few auditionees as back-ups in case one of our scheduled villains can't make a show, or if we end up adding more shows than currently scheduled.<br><br>Please contact cocorunseverything@gmail.com or message @mastermindschicago on instagram if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing your ideas!</div>	CallToAudition	2	2025-10-16 01:00:36.013354	2025-10-17 20:55:54.230713
9	instruction_text	<div>Calling all evil-doers, swindlers, and ne'er-do-wells! Chicago's most nefarious power point-driven character comedy show needs you!<br><br>Each <em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S. </em>(Menaces Assessing Strategic Tactics End Rogues Making Intelligent Maneuvers Diabolically Shhh) show is a board meeting of villains, during which <strong>four dastardly characters each present an evil scheme via slides</strong> to each other and to the audience. We have a different cast of villains each time and are currently looking for people who can do our <strong>Jan 30</strong> and<strong> Feb 20</strong> shows.<br><br>For this show, you will create a character (can be an existing pop culture entity, a character you make up entirely, a real life person, a concept, etc...be creative!) and give an 8-min power point presentation laying out an evil scheme (be creative here, too.) After each presentation, there is a Q&amp;A with the audience/other villains, so come prepared to defend your scheme!<br><br>What we are looking for:</div><ul><li><strong>A fully-fleshed out scheme</strong> that could make a reasonable 8-minute presentation and not just a one joke concept.</li><li><strong>A strong visual element</strong>. We want cool costumes/props and interesting presentation graphics.</li><li><strong>Villains with strong motivation</strong> and character, not just a funny plan.</li><li><strong>Silly plans!</strong> The tone of this particular show is playful and we don't want anything too serious. While everyone is playing a no-good scoundrel, their evil plans should be low-stakes and non-hateful. (Schemes presented in past shows include building a swamp-themed theme park, and getting Batman to be your date to the school dance.)</li><li><strong>Ability to improvise.</strong> While you can script your presentation itself, there is an audience Q&amp;A portion and banter/business bits between presentations that you need to stay in character for, and be ready to play with.</li></ul><div><br>Half of the total ticket sales will go into a pool to be split evenly by the performing talent, so<strong> you will be paid</strong>, but we can't guarantee any particular amount.<br> <br>Since the majority of the preparation for this show is individual character/slide work, <strong>we will not be having rehearsals</strong>. There will be a short online cast meeting at some point about a week before the show to make introductions and answer any questions.<br><br>We will be accepting submissions through Jan 6. <strong>You will know by Jan 9</strong> if you are cast in one of these shows.<br><br>People who have submitted to <em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S. </em>before are welcome to submit again with the same character or a new one. If you have presented with us before, it needs to be a new scheme. If you were not cast before, think about what can be improved to potentially fit the show better.<br><br><em>M.A.S.T.E.R.M.I.N.D.S.</em> is the creation of Gib Christensen and is produced by Coco Runs Everything.

You will be notified via email by end of day Sep 10 letting you know if/when you have received an audition slot.\n\nWe are looking to add several improvisers and a couple hosts to the pool of talent that we cast shows from. The audition will simply consist of doing improv games in a group and there is no need to bring/prepare anything other than a good attitude!\n\nComedy Pageant is a short-form improv show with a beauty pageant motif. Each Comedy Pageant show features one host and four sash-wearing “contestants” (North Bitch, West Bitch, South Bitch, and East Bitch) who compete in various improv games to win the tiara and sash that tell the world they are the ultimate Pageant Bitch. (We would like to stress that “bitch” is a gender-neutral and polite title in Comedy Pageant World.) The games will be divided into a “talent section”, “personal interview section”, etc., like a beauty pageant, but will be classic games you know like “New Choice”, “Sex With Me”, “Top That”, etc. For shows, the host will be dressed formally, while the contestants are welcome to wear whatever they’re comfortable performing in (plus their sash).\n\nStarting Oct 3, we will be performing bi-weekly Fridays 7pm at Stars & Garters. Each show lasts 75 min (including a 10 min intermission). Call time for performers will be 6:30pm.\n\nWe believe in compensating talent. For each show, each performer (contestants and hosts) will receive either $20 or $1 per ticket sold, whichever is greater. Each week’s winning Pageant Bitch will also receive a $10 scholarship to Burger King (a joke prize, but a legit gift card!).\n\nWe will have a rehearsal/kick-off event for all talent we bring on at 11am on Sat Sep 27. Attendance will not be required, but as this is currently our only rehearsal for the year, we highly encourage coming so we can discuss show structure, make sure everyone is on the same page with how to play our games, and get to know each other!\n\nPlease feel free to email cocorunseverything@gmail.com or message @comedy_pageant on instagram if you have any questions. We want to set you up for success!	Thank you for submitting an application to audition for Comedy Pageant! We are excited to (hopefully) see you! We will notify you via email before end of day Sep 10 to let you know if/when you have an audition slot.\n\nWhile we would love to be able to give all applicants a chance to audition, we have limited time to work with, and will not be able to see everyone who applies this time. If you do not get selected this time, keep in touch, as we should have more opportunities available in the future as this new show grows.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to email cocorunseverything@gmail.com or message @comedy_pageant on instagram.	in_person	f	f	f	t	f	2025-11-13 01:11:46.06339	\N	f	f	managers	t	t	f	t

71	4	12	The most important thing for an improv scene partner is definetly support. I think in any scene all characters involved should embrace wherever the scene is going, even if it’s not what they had originally planned when stepping out on stage.

1	Person	47	48	I've had the pleasure of seeing Trevor perform improv, stand-up, and sketch comedy many many times during the 19 years I've known him. He is one of the funniest and most creative people I know and always brings a unique flavor to any production he's a part of. His humor is absurd and emotional. His talent for characters and voices is remarkable. He's a supportive team member, a confident performer, and an insightful producer.\n\nWe are currently working together on Laugh-Along, Live! and Comedy Pageant, both producing and performing together, and I will continue looking for opportunities to work with Trevor, because I know it will be good.	2025-12-03 02:25:31.92851	2025-12-03 02:25:31.92851	\N
